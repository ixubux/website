# Welcome to ixubux's BlogPost.

It may be a little boring (actually too boring if you're not a nerd but you'll get to see a lot here. Such as things I learnt, experiences I had, and much more.)

## My blog contains different sections and fields I have things to yap about.

*Some of them are:*
- My opinion on [the last keyboard I bought](https://amzn.in/d/5M4yW4n).
- The work principles and philosophies I follow.
- Things I've learned by doing hit and trials.
- My opinions on people who are either not or do not understand irony or sarcasm.
- Some useful stuff in terms of software and OSes everyone should use
