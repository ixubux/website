# MK1300 V2
### Yep, that is the keyboard I bought recently (7 Aug 2025) for â‚¹1200 ($13.72)

It was 4th of August when I was just browsing normally, I had newly installed an extension for amazon for it to not show sponsored or recommended results and just to test that, I went to the [amazon.in](https://amazon.in) and then I just randomly searched for *mechanical keyboards* and just started scrolling.

As I was scrolling, I came passed by this keyboard listed with a price tag of 1200, I saw that and continued scrolling and suddenly realised.

*Wait. What?* And then scrolled back and started reading carefully if it mentioned **refurbished** or **semi-mechanical** anywhere and surprisingly it was neither of them.

So I just took a risk and ordered it, gambling my 1200.
